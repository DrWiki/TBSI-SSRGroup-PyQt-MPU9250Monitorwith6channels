# TUSBF: An UltralTool for data collecting via UDP/TCP/SerialPort/Bluetooth/TestFile



## Introduction

Hello every, this is DrWiki.

I developed a easy-used tool for collecting data via WIFI-UDP/WIFI-TCP/Serial Port/Bluetooth/Test File.

Actually, it's based on pyQt5 and is a improved Qwidget from QGroupBox class. And thanks a lot to XXXXX who has released an awsome UDP/TCP demo on github, which also is the most important material That I learned from. 

 Here is the relationships between all the Qt and custom class that is involved. It's edited using UML.  By the way, UML  is a good tool to show that  but it's not convenient enough and I am still looking for a better one.
